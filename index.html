        <p>This is the language I have had the most experience in as I have taken 2 courses - CS161-162 - that were all in this language.
            My experience goes as far as complex object-oriented programming as well as data structures and algorithms.

        <p>I don't have as much experience in this langauge as c++ but I have made efforts outside of school to get familiar with this language and all of its capabilities.
          This is definitely my favorite and will continue to get better with it as there are many fascinating projects that I would like to do with this language. Including:
          <ul id = "c-list">
            -Making my own Programming Langauge
            <br>
            -Making an operating system
            <br>
            -Getting involved in Embedded Systems
          </ul>

        <div class = "lang-pic">
        <img src = "asm.png">
        </div>
        <p>I have taken one course in which we used this language and while it was difficult for me I find it very interesting and I very much want to keep learning about
          computer architecture through assembly.
